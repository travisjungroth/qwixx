# Qwixx
This is a [dice game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131260/qwixx) I enjoy. I wrote this to use with reinforcement learning, but you can play it on the command line. It's an exercise in using the right Python class for the job. It uses [enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), [protocols](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol), [type aliases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases) and [tuple subclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple).
